# Microsoft Malware Prediction

Predicts malware in machines running Microsoft Windows using various ensemble methods. Does data preprocessing, using feature elemination with correlation, and train into Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Then compares each model's complexity and accuracy/error rate.
